# FPGA-based-power-quality-enhancer

The objective of this project is enhancing power quality of transmission line by reducing harmonics. It detects harmonic contents real time and cancel out them using active power filter. All the processing and controlling parts are done by FPGA. Following functions has been implemented on FPGA using Verilog.
•	Analog to Digital conversion using XADC IP.
•	Running Discrete Fourier transform.
•	UART serial communication with FPGA and PC.
